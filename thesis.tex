\section{Deterministic dual between discrete time series and ordered multigraph}

There's a fairly big previous literature on this. Visibility graph, dual graph, spectral methods, recurrence graph methods, steal forward citations for this.

What's the ordered multigraph that I'm talking about? Mathematical definition. Talk about the construction of the multigraph from the time series.

Why do you need a discrete time series? How are we discretizing our time series now? Why is it a deterministic dual, what is the algorithm and process by which we create this deterministic dual: that is, how to get from multigraph to time series?

Recreate the time series of logistic map here.

Note tha time series resampling is now possible deterministically. Do it with the logistic map here.

Do the time series resampling with the damned other things.

Now, do complex network analysis things with the VR data and with logistic map.
